#  UCR-DatasetAnalizer

I just wrote this program to extract essential information about the datasets provided by "UCR_UEA_datasets."

Currently, this basic information contains:

1- each dataset's name

2- each dataset's shape

3- The list of possible pool_sizes for each dataset. 

(If we say dataset X contains N observations, this list includes the divisors of N. I needed this info in another project)

The above information will be saved to a text file named "datasetInfo.txt"

I've added the results I got to this repository.
